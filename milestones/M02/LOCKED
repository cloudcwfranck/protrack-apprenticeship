This milestone is currently locked and cannot be started.

WHY IS THIS LOCKED?
═══════════════════

ProTrack enforces sequential learning to ensure you build foundational skills
before tackling advanced topics. You cannot start M02 until you've successfully
completed and demonstrated competency in M01.

This isn't arbitrary—cloud engineering concepts build on each other. Skipping
fundamentals leads to:
  - Incomplete understanding of Azure resource organization
  - Security vulnerabilities in advanced deployments
  - Inability to troubleshoot complex issues
  - Poor architectural decisions

HOW TO UNLOCK M02
═════════════════

Complete these steps in order:

  1. ✅ Complete all M01 requirements:
     - Deploy Terraform infrastructure
     - Fill out docs/M01/runbook.md
     - Collect evidence via ./scripts/collect_evidence.sh M01

  2. ✅ Submit Pull Request for M01:
     - Create branch: git checkout -b m01-work
     - Commit your work
     - Push and open PR to main

  3. ✅ Pass CI Validation:
     - Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
     - Fix any errors that CI reports
     - Ensure all checks are green ✅

  4. ✅ Get PR Approved:
     - Address reviewer feedback
     - Make any requested changes

  5. ✅ Merge Your PR:
     - Click "Merge" button in GitHub
     - M02 unlocks automatically within minutes

WHAT UNLOCKING LOOKS LIKE
══════════════════════════

After your M01 PR merges:
  - This LOCKED file disappears
  - M02 Terraform files appear in this directory
  - M02 documentation appears in docs/M02/
  - CI allows you to work on M02

You'll receive a notification when unlock completes.

TIMELINE
════════

Typical unlock timeline:
  - M01 work: 3-7 days
  - CI validation: 2-5 minutes
  - Review process: 1-3 days
  - Unlock after merge: Immediate

Total time from starting M01 to M02 unlock: ~1-2 weeks

CAN I PREVIEW M02 REQUIREMENTS?
═══════════════════════════════

No. The full requirements are hidden until unlock.

Why? Because previewing advanced requirements before completing fundamentals:
  - Encourages skipping learning steps
  - Leads to cargo-culting solutions without understanding
  - Defeats the purpose of sequential mastery

Trust the process. Complete M01 first.

DON'T TRY TO BYPASS THIS
════════════════════════

Attempting to:
  ❌ Delete this LOCKED file manually → CI will fail
  ❌ Modify .github/workflows/ to skip checks → CI will fail
  ❌ Create M02 files yourself → CI will fail
  ❌ Copy from other students → Plagiarism detection will catch it

The locking system is CI-enforced and cannot be bypassed.

CURRENT STATUS
══════════════

🔒 M02 Status: LOCKED
✅ M01 Status: Check by running `ls milestones/M01/main.tf`

Next Action: Complete M01 and submit your PR

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're doing great by completing M01 first. This structure exists to make you
a better engineer, not to slow you down.

Keep going. M02 will be here when you're ready.
