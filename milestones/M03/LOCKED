╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

This milestone is currently locked and cannot be started.

WHY IS THIS LOCKED?
═══════════════════

Milestone 03 represents advanced Azure cloud engineering topics that build
directly on concepts from M01 and M02. Attempting M03 without mastering the
previous milestones will result in:

  - Inability to understand networking and security concepts
  - Poor architectural decisions
  - Deployments that work but violate best practices
  - Frustration and wasted time

ProTrack enforces sequential completion to ensure you're truly ready.

HOW TO UNLOCK M03
═════════════════

Complete BOTH previous milestones in order:

  STEP 1: Complete M01
  ────────────────────
  ✅ Deploy Azure storage infrastructure
  ✅ Document architecture in runbook
  ✅ Collect evidence
  ✅ Pass CI validation
  ✅ Merge PR to main

  STEP 2: Complete M02
  ────────────────────
  ⏳ (Unlocks after M01 merges)
  ✅ Complete M02 requirements (revealed after unlock)
  ✅ Pass CI validation
  ✅ Merge PR to main

  STEP 3: M03 Unlocks Automatically
  ──────────────────────────────────
  ⏳ (Unlocks immediately after M02 merge)
  🎉 This LOCKED file disappears
  📂 M03 requirements appear

CURRENT REQUIREMENTS TO UNLOCK
═══════════════════════════════

Before you can start M03, you must:

  [ ] M01 deployed and merged ← START HERE
  [ ] M02 unlocked
  [ ] M02 deployed and merged
  [ ] M03 unlocked ← YOU ARE HERE

TIMELINE
════════

Typical progression timeline:
  - M01: 1-2 weeks
  - M02: 1-3 weeks
  - M03: 2-4 weeks

Total time from starting ProTrack to M03 unlock: ~4-9 weeks

This timeline assumes:
  - Focused work (10-15 hours/week)
  - Passing CI on first try (good practices)
  - Minimal review cycles

WHAT IS M03 ABOUT?
══════════════════

We can't reveal full requirements yet, but M03 typically covers:
  - Advanced Azure networking
  - Multi-tier application architecture
  - Security hardening and compliance
  - Production-grade monitoring and logging
  - Disaster recovery planning

These topics require solid understanding of M01 and M02 concepts.

DON'T TRY TO BYPASS THIS
════════════════════════

The same locking enforcement from M02 applies here:

  ❌ Manual deletion of LOCKED files → CI fails
  ❌ Copying solutions from others → Plagiarism detection
  ❌ Modifying CI workflows → Validation fails
  ❌ Creating M03 files early → Locked milestone check fails

There are no shortcuts. Complete M01 and M02 first.

CURRENT STATUS
══════════════

🔒 M03 Status: LOCKED (you are here)
🔒 M02 Status: Check `ls milestones/M02/LOCKED`
✅ M01 Status: Check `ls milestones/M01/main.tf`

Next Action: If you haven't started M01, start there.

FOCUS ON YOUR CURRENT MILESTONE
════════════════════════════════

If you're reading this file, you're likely:

  1. Just starting ProTrack → Focus on M01
  2. Curious about M03 → That's great, but complete M01 and M02 first
  3. Trying to skip ahead → Don't. It won't work and wastes time.

The best thing you can do right now is close this file and work on whatever
milestone is currently unlocked for you.

NEED HELP?
══════════

- Read: docs/MILESTONE_LOCKING.md (complete explanation)
- Review: README.md (quickstart guide)
- Ask: GitHub issues or ProTrack discussions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

M03 will be here when you're ready. Take your time. Build mastery, not just
completion checkmarks.

See you after M02. 👨‍💻
